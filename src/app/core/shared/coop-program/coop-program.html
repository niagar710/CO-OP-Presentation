  <p class="description">
    The Software Engineer Co-op Program at INPO gives students the chance to
    work on real software projects while building technical and professional
    skills in a collaborative environment. As a co-op, I contributed to
    application development using tools like C#, Angular, and SQL Server, and
    worked closely with mentors and full-time developers to support ongoing
    projects and improve internal systems. The experience offered a strong mix
    of hands-on coding, mentorship, and exposure to enterprise-level tools and
    workflows.

    During my State Farm internship, I worked on real enterprise software
    projects, focusing on automating processes, improving internal tools, and
    developing customer-facing UI components. I contributed to ServiceNow
    automation, frontend and backend development, and cross-team collaboration,
    gaining experience in secure deployment, Agile methodologies, and full-stack
    development best practices. This role strengthened both my technical and
    professional skills while providing hands-on exposure to enterprise
    workflows.
