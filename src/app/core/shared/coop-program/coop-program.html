  <p class="description">
    The Programmer Analyst Co-op Program at INPO gives students the chance to work on real software projects while building technical and professional skills in a collaborative environment. As a co-op, I contributed to application development using tools like C#, Angular, and SQL Server, and worked closely with mentors and full-time developers to support ongoing projects and improve internal systems. The experience offered a strong mix of hands-on coding, mentorship, and exposure to enterprise-level tools and workflows.
