        <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Debugging PNP Issues</h3>
        <p>
          Worked on ServiceNow incident tickets regarding issues that internal
          and external users were experiencing with the People & Places
          application. This included access, permissions, failure of
          functionalities, and data inconsistencies. With the guidance and
          assistance of second-level developers, I was able to understand and
          resolve the issues via debugging and SSMS query scripts if needed.
